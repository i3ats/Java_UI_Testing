# Java_UI_Testing

Some simple examples of testing using AssertJ-Swing and TestFX

## Run the tests

```shell
./gradlew test
```

## Java FX vs Swing testing

- JavaFX can be run in headless mode for testing
- JavaFX is the newer of the two and is the recommended choice for new projects
- JavaFX is more modern and has better support for modern UI features
